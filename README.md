# Selenium

Selenium automation test framework Build Status

I recently planned to write it in Python. Anyone interested can fork it. First, you need to install Python, then install selenium lib pip install -U selenium

Use Selenium + testng + Jenkins + Maven

Use Page object model

Use log4j

How to use:

 1. Install Maven configuration environment variables
 2. git clone 
 3. You can also use Jenkins directly to trigger mvn test

Roadmap

 1. Using the Builder Design Pattern (Done)
 2. Optimize test report (in-progress)
 3. Use containers to abstract away separate screenshot services
 4. Refactor page element loading function
 5. Added the function of predicting the environment, judging the environment by the http response code
 6. Selenium UI automation optimization test script experience summary
